  Abstract                 = {<p>Power is the ability to influence others towards the attainment of specific goals, and it is a fundamental force that shapes behavior at all levels of human existence. Several theories on the nature of power in social life exist, especially in the context of social influence. Yet, in bargaining situations, surprisingly little is known about its role in shaping social preferences. Such preferences are considered to be the main explanation for observed behavior in a wide range of experimental settings. In this work, we set out to understand the role of bargaining power in the stylized environment of a Generalized Ultimatum Game (GUG). We modify the payoff structure of the standard Ultimatum Game (UG) to investigate three situations: two in which the power balance is either against the proposer or against the responder, and a balanced situation. We find that other-regarding preferences, as measured by the amount of money donated by participants, do not change with the amount of power, but power changes the offers and acceptance rates systematically. Notably, unusually high acceptance rates for lower offers were observed. This finding suggests that social preferences may be invariant to the balance of power and confirms that the role of power on human behavior deserves more attention.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {<p>Traditional fact checking by expert journalists cannot keep up with the enormous volume of information that is now generated online. Computational fact checking may significantly enhance our ability to evaluate the veracity of dubious information. Here we show that the complexities of human fact checking can be approximated quite well by finding the shortest path between concept nodes under properly defined semantic proximity metrics on knowledge graphs. Framed as a network problem this approach is feasible with efficient computational techniques. We evaluate this approach by examining tens of thousands of claims related to history, entertainment, geography, and biographical information using a public knowledge graph extracted from Wikipedia. Statements independently known to be true consistently receive higher support via our method than do false ones. These findings represent a significant step toward scalable computational fact-checking methods that may one day mitigate the spread of harmful misinformation.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {B\"uchi automata are widely used as a modeling formalism in formal verification. The emptiness check procedure is used to carry on the model checking of a model $\mathcal{M}$ of a system, against an LTL formula $\phi$, that expresses the desidered properties the system should satisfy. Algorithms for the emptiness check on B\"uchi automata are able to find a faulty computation, if the language accepted by the automaton of the synchronized product of $\mathcal{M}$ and $\phi$ is non empty. Nonetheless, these algorithms don't perform any optimization on such solution. In this paper we propose an ant colony optimization algorithm for the emptiness check of a subclass of B\"uchi automata, that runs on-the-fly, that is without storing the whole digraph of the automaton in main memory, thus avoiding the problem of exponential growth of the state space. Our approach features a non standard search strategy, with the capability for artificial ants to backtrack during the constructive search, and to modify the graph of the automaton, by removing parts of it when no longer interesting for exploration.},

Wikipedia's official guidelines require that only topics that meet "notability" standards be included with a dedicated article. Decisions as to whether a topic is "notable" are made by groups of self-appointed reviewers, who assess the alleged encyclopaedic nature of a topic via so called "Article for Deletion" discussions. We analyse the structure and dynamics of these discussions in order to identify possible biases affecting their outcome. We show in particular the effects of voter heterogeneity and herding behaviour on the functioning of these collective deliberation processes.},
